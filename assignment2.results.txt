["\nFrom your Yahoo liberal partners WaPo. We know you like money WaPo.\n\nTrump’s grade on the economy ticks back up to A-\n\nhttps://www.yahoo.com/news/trumps-grade-economy-ticks-back-163733792.html\n\nIn the year since Donald Trump won the U.S. presidency, earnings have crept upward, employers have added 1.8 million jobs, and the stock market has soared by 22%. That’s enough to boost Trump’s grade on the economy to A- in the latest installment of the Yahoo Finance Trumponomics Report Card.\n\nTrump’s initial grade was a B when we launched the report card in May. Strong job growth — including the manufacturing sector — and the seemingly unstoppable stock market pushed his grade to B+ over the summer, then to A- in September. The grade fell by one notch after a weak employment report for September, which was largely due to hurricanes that slammed Texas and Florida. But hiring came back strong in October, pushing the grade back to A-.\n\nOur Trumponomics Report Card measures six key economic indicators under Trump compared with six prior presidents at the same point in their presidency, going back to Jimmy Carter in the 1970s. Moody’s Analytics provides the data, which we convert into letter grades. (Here’s our complete methodology.) Job growth was stronger at the same point in the first terms of Jimmy Carter in 1977 and Bill Clinton in 1993. The stock market did better in the early days of Barack Obama and George H.W. Bush. But Trump is presiding over a kind of Goldilocks economy that isn’t exactly roaring, but it's doing reasonably well all around. Here’s how he measures up on our six indicators:", 'Um, well the rain didn\'t deter me because I already voted "in-place absentee" two weeks before. (The election folks will tell you there is no "early voting" in Virginia but there really is if you go to the government centers during October.  No lines and weather be damned!)', "Sure, if your mission is limited to getting back to October 2016.\n\nThat's a nation in which nobody except the rich have had any independent influence getting federal laws passed since Carter. It's a nation where all the nation's economic growth has been captured by the top few % since the same period. It's a nation where middle income was once middle class, and today is once again too low to afford a middle class life.\n\nA great deal of American leadership thinks that's progress. It is progress toward wrapping up the American experiment and returning to the industrial/information age equivalent of millennia of norm of elite ownership and governance of everything important.", 'I am neither Spanish nor Catalan.  I just want to say that fcueva pointed out that not only is the Catalan voting system electoral, all of Spain is.  In that case we can understand that the Catalan voting system is electoral BECAUSE the Spanish system is.  The article above, written by an "expert" does not mention this, although it sort of pertains to his thesis that seems to be that Catalan elections are not 100% democratic.  But all that aside, the results of the referendum that was held on 1 October were counted vote by vote.  That was not electoral.  And the referendum that the Spanish government has refused to allow, that too would be counted vote by vote.  It leads one to wonder if they are so certain of their silent majority, why they are afraid to have such a vote.  And the writer of this piece doesn\'t want to touch that either.', 'Obummer???.... Killary???? Catch up there. Of course "The Donald" has signed 64 executive orders as of October the 13th. Obama signed 21 executive orders during the same period. Talk about "Constitutional" overreach. #RESIST! ']


##### query for jobs
['The "opposing and openly hostile media", as you put it, are doing their damn jobs. They\'re reporting his failure of a Presidency with honesty, persistence, and transparency -- all three things he and his cabinet lack.\n\nAs well as you.', 'Malignant narcissist Trump should resign and go into exile in Russia with his BFF! Many, many Americans would be happy to see Trump and Company, all swamp monsters, to end their constant divisive lying and negative messaging. Sanders, Miller, Conway and Hicks should be looking for jobs now!', 'There are still voters who hope Trump will change? What deluded fools they are. His "victory speech" was a con job just like his entire life.', 'Hey, Tяumplings, how\'s that repealy-replacy, drain the swampy stuff working out for ya, anyway? And how about all those great factory and coal-mining jobs that don\'t take no schoolin\'? All better now? Enjoying all that winning yet?\n\n"...I will be president for all Americans..." Yeah, right. And he has a bridge for sale in NYC that\'s in just your color. Believe me...', "Trump is turning out to be even worse than the other second-place finishers who got to be president. We should probably stop letting also-rans have the job. If you were hiring someone, you wouldn't go with the second-best candidate."]


##### query for Trump
["This is telling. We know that 30 to 35% of voters are so angry at elites that they will cheer on anything that Trump does as long as he plays that card. However, The rest of the electorate don't like Trump's game and are up for grabs. Time for Democrats to stop grasping for the fringes and compromise. Otherwise you'll have Trump for another 7 years.", "Is that supposed to be a clever take? Why would Trump fear an election result that they knew they were going to lose. That's like saying Trump should be concerned he lost NY, California, or DC. Those were never going to be wins for him so he could care less.", 'Bannon the Drunk failed miserably. What goes around comes around. The truth is indeed powerful, President Bannon (President Bannonâ€™s stooge Trump, you need to take note, too!)', "Nope. Going after your political enemies is a Trump tactic and unworthy of real Americans.\n\nWe can insist that the IRS start really enforcing churches who do political electioneering because that's against the law. But not all evangelicals are conservatives and it is wrong to try and destroy your political enemies in a free democracy.\n\nThe thing to do is to fix the problems like voter suppression and gerrymandering which the corrupt want when they're in power. No more dark money. No more lobbyists for foreign governments who don't register. No more political ads on the internet where you can only see them if you're a special group and you can't tell who's paying for them.\n\nDo not make martyrs of the Evangelicals. 1. It's what they want and fits into their Christian persecution complex and 2. nothing blows up into a civil war faster than religious groups fighting.\n\nTake away the money men who use the Evangelicals and you'll be doing something more powerful but do it without retribution.", 'What was even better than seeing Gillespie lose was seeing Trump immediately betray him']


##### query for hate
["Thank you!\n\nAmerican politics is compromise. We have many different types of states and peoples and compromise is how we hammer out something we can all live with. But Nancy Pelosi keeps her eye on the prize and moves us forward.\n\nEver wonder why we don't hear this hate for Schumer?", 'So how does it change the overall anti-Repo vote totals for you, or anyone else, to *still* hate Trump? Unless there is evidence to show that voters who did not hate Trump in 2016 have flipped and do hate Trump now, nothing has really changed. Percentages do not count, only absolute vote totals really count.', "Yeah I hate Trump as president, he is terrible. And not because he is GOP or because of race (see Obama haters) but because he stinks and is hurting regular folks. Already his first year is seeing growth slow, Obama's last year was stronger for the economy. The GOP always causes a recession, and the signs are starting. ", "It's been a full year since I woke up to good news.\n\nThe people that stood up for American values, that stood against bigotry and hate, that stood against misogyny, that stood against corruption and megalomania, that stood against fascist populism...won.", 'you would have to have an IQ lower than 60 to be "stunned" that Democrats did so well yesterday.  the pendulum swings, 2016 was a high-water mark for Republicans and thanks to the lunacy in the WH, and incompetency on Capitol Hill, Dems will have back their Congressional control by the next cycle, and more than likely boot Trump out of office in 2020.  as a lifelong republican I hate seeing this, but also the arseholes like mitch mcconnell and paul ryan deserve to be kicked to the curb for being such idiots.  sit on the bench for 8 or 12 years or better yet leave.']
